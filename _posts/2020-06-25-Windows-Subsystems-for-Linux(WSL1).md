> In order to install Windows Subsystems for Linux(a.k.a WSL), you first need to check the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" option in Windows Features:

> After that your pc or laptop needs to restart.

> Next, Open the Microsoft Store then type "WSL", you will see a list of apps. In this post, I will use Debian(I personally like Debian over Ubuntu or CentOS), so download debian and install it:
